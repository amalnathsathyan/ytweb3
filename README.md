# Reviral It! 🚀

Reviral It is a decentralized, community-governed video sharing platform where users can compete for weekly prizes by making their 'lost' videos go viral again. Users can submit any video, even links from YouTube, and join the exciting challenge of reviraling their content. Our goal is to evolve into a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) after building a strong community.

Although still under development, we have hosted a public preview for users to explore and provide feedback. Check it out here: [https://ytweb3.vercel.app](https://ytweb3.vercel.app)
